# HW1

My scripts already contains a token to use `curl` to download the file from Gthub, but in case that the model download fails, you can download the file `models.tgz` with URL [https://github.com/topjohnwu/ADLxMLDS2017/releases/download/hw1/models.tgz](https://github.com/topjohnwu/ADLxMLDS2017/releases/download/hw1/models.tgz) (note: this URL only works in browsers that is authenticated).
